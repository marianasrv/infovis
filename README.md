# Information Visualization Project
This project was developed under the InfoVis course of the Masters Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
We developed a visualization about a subject of our choice. We picked books.

## Dataset
We used the dataset "goodbooks-10k" from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k).
We used Pentaho to preprocess the dataset, in order to achieve a reasonable amout of data.
