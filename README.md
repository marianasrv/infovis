# Information Visualization Project üìä
This project was developed under the InfoVis course of the Masters Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
We developed a visualization about books. We used the dataset [goodbooks-10k](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k) from kaggle.

In our visualization, you can search for books by genre and by author.
In the scatterplot, the books are organized by publication year.
With our line chart, we know the average rating for each year. In this chart, we can change the range of year that we can evaluate.
In the bar chart, the books are ordered by popularity in the selected range of years.
Finally, we have a network chart to check the similarity between variuos books.
